# TRAX LRS 3.0

## Introduction

**TRAX LRS 1.0** focused on the LRS core features and xAPI compliance. This was acheived by passing the ADL conformance test suite and being listed in the [ADL adopter registry](https://adopters.adlnet.gov/products/all/0).

**TRAX LRS 2.0** focused on adding valuable and unique features, like fine permissions tuning, extended APIs, data privacy, CMI5 integration, Elasticsearch connector, etc.

With **TRAX LRS 3.0**, such features will continue to evolve, but at the same time, we want to focus on maintenability, scalability and security.
