# TRAX LRS 3.0

> This document details potential changes coming with TRAX LRS 3.0. As we are in the early stage of its design, all the aspects described in this document are **subject to change**. At this stage, there is no guarranty that all the described features will be implemented.


## Introduction

**TRAX LRS 1.0** focused on the LRS core features and xAPI compliance. This was acheived by passing the ADL conformance test suite and being listed in the [ADL adopter registry](https://adopters.adlnet.gov/products/all/0).

**TRAX LRS 2.0** focused on adding valuable and unique features, like fine permissions tuning, extended APIs, data privacy, CMI5 integration, Elasticsearch connector, etc.

With **TRAX LRS 3.0**, such features will continue to mature, but at the same time, we will focus on scalability and security. We believe most of TRAX LRS early adopters are now moving from experimental projects to production. Scalabity and security are becoming a big concern and we must address them with new capabilities.
